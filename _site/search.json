    "text": "Australia’s 2019–20 “Black Summer” bushfires were among the most devastating in history—34 people lost their lives, thousands of homes were destroyed, and millions of hectares burned.\nThese events raised an urgent question:\n&gt; Has climate change increased the likelihood of extreme bushfi44re weather in southeast Australia?\nThis blog summarises the findings of van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), who combined observed weather records and climate-model simulations to quantify the human influence on bushfire risk.\nTheir results show that the probability of an extreme Fire Weather Index (FWI) season is now about 30% higher than it was in a pre-industrial climate."

    "section": "🧠 Conclusion",
    "text": "🧠 Conclusion\nHuman-induced climate change has shifted Australia’s baseline bushfire risk upward.\nEven though natural variability still affects individual seasons, the overall odds are now “loaded” toward hotter, more dangerous summers.\nTo prepare for this new normal, researchers and decision-makers should:\n1. Integrate climate-scenario data into bushfire management and planning.\n2. Strengthen early-warning systems and community education.\n3. Continue fuel-load and land-use management to reduce fire intensity.\nAs (Oldenborgh et al. 2021) and (Dowdy 2018) highlight, adapting to this warmer world requires both mitigation of greenhouse emissions and practical resilience strategies.\n\nThis post was created as part of Monash University’s ETC5523 unit — Communicating with Data."
