    "text": "Australia’s 2019–20 “Black Summer” bushfires were among the worst on record—34 people lost their lives, thousands of homes were destroyed, and millions of hectares burned.\nScientists and policymakers have since asked a critical question:\n&gt; Has climate change increased the likelihood of extreme bushfire weather in southeast Australia?\nThis post summarises the findings of van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), which used observed and modelled weather data to estimate how much human influence has changed the probability of severe fire weather. Their results reveal that the chance of an extreme Fire Weather Index (FWI) season is now about 30 percent higher than in a pre-industrial climate."
