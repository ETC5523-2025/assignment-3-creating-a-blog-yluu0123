    "section": "🧠 Conclusion",
    "text": "🧠 Conclusion\nHuman-induced climate change has shifted Australia’s baseline bushfire risk upward.\nEven though natural variability still affects individual seasons, the overall odds are now “loaded” toward hotter, more dangerous summers.\nTo prepare for this new normal, researchers and decision-makers should:\n1. Integrate climate-scenario data into bushfire management and planning.\n2. Strengthen early-warning systems and community education.\n3. Continue fuel-load and land-use management to reduce fire intensity.\nAs (Oldenborgh et al. 2021) and (Dowdy 2018) highlight, adapting to this warmer world requires both mitigation of greenhouse emissions and practical resilience strategies.\n\nThis post was written as part of Monash Un44iversity’s ETC5523 — Communicating with Data assessment."
