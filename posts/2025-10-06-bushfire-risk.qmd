## Why this matters (Problem)

Australia’s 2019–20 **“Black Summer”** killed 34 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and caused major environmental damage.\
This post asks a simple, public-facing question:\

\> *Has human-driven climate change increased the chance of extreme fire weather in south-east Australia?*

Researchers comparing today’s climate with a pre-industrial world find that the chance of an **extreme Fire Weather Index (FWI) season** is now **about 30% higher**.

##  Data Description

The study integrates both **observations** and **model experiments**

- **ERA5 Reanalysis (1979–2020)** – temperature, rainfall and drought indices (Hersbach et al., 2019).  
- **Bureau of Meteorology Fire Weather Index (FWI)** – the key indicator of bushfire danger (Dowdy 2018).  
- **Climate models (CMIP5/6 ensembles)** – simulations with and without greenhouse gases to separate human influence (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021).

An “extreme season” was defined as any year with a **seasonal maximum FWI ≥ 2019–20**.  
Event probabilities were estimated using extreme-value fits for both climates; the **Probability Ratio (PR)** = _current / pre-industrial risk_.  

Below is a simple visualisation of this idea (not real data but representative of their result).
