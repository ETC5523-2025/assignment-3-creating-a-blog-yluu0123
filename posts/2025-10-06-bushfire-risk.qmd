## 🔥 Problem Description

Australia’s **2019–20 “Black Summer”** bushfires were among the most devastating in history—34 people lost their lives, thousands of homes were destroyed, and millions of hectares burned.  
These events raised an urgent question:  
> *Has climate change increased the likelihood of extreme bushfire weather in southeast Australia?*

This blog summarises the findings of *van Oldenborgh et al.* (2021), who combined observed weather records and climate-model simulations to quantify the human influence on bushfire risk.  
Their results show that the probability of an **extreme Fire Weather Index (FWI) season** is now **about 30% higher** than it was in a pre-industrial climate.

## 🌏 Data and Findings

The study used multiple independent data sources:

- **ERA5 Reanalysis (1979–2020)** — records of temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind (Hersbach et al., 2019)  
- **Bureau of Meteorology Fire Weather Index (FWI)** — a measure of daily bushfire danger (Dowdy 2018)  
- **Climate-model ensembles (CMIP5/6)** — simulations comparing current and pre-industrial climate worlds (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021)

Together, these sources reveal a clear upward shift in fire-weather risk.  
Across all datasets, extreme FWI seasons are roughly **30% more likely** in the present climate, and **extreme heat events** occur about **twice as often**, while dryness signals remain weak or uncertain.

## 📈 Analysis

### 🔹 Figure 1 – Probability Ratio (PR)

**@fig-fwi.**  Probability ratio (PR) for an FWI as high as observed in 2019–20 or higher, based on multiple climate models.

As shown in @fig-fwi, all five model ensembles (ERA5, CanESM2, EC-Earth, IPSL-CM6, and weather@home) show **PR > 1**, meaning extreme fire-weather seasons are now more likely than before industrialisation.
