## 🔥 Problem Description

Australia’s **2019–20 “Black Summer”** bushfires were among the most devastating in history—34 people lost their lives, thousands of homes were destroyed, and millions of hectares burned.  
These events raised an urgent question:  
> *Has climate change increased the likelihood of extreme bushfi44re weather in southeast Australia?*

This blog summarises the findings of *van Oldenborgh et al.* (2021), who combined observed weather records and climate-model simulations to quantify the human influence on bushfire risk.  
Their results show that the probability of an **extreme Fire Weather Index (FWI) season** is now **about 30% higher** than it was in a pre-industrial climate.

## 🌏 Data and Findings

The study used multiple independent data sources:

- **ERA5 Reanalysis (1979–2020)** — records of temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind (Hersbach et al., 2019)  
- **Bureau of Meteorology Fire Weather Index (FWI)** — a measure of daily bushfire danger (Dowdy 2018)  
- **Climate-model ensembles (CMIP5/6)** — simulations comparing current and pre-industrial climate worlds (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021)

Together, these sources reveal a clear upward shift in fire-weather risk.  
Across all datasets, extreme FWI seasons are roughly **30% more likely** in the present climate, and **extreme heat events** occur about **twice as often**, while dryness signals remain weak or uncertain.

## 📈 Analysis

### 🔹 Figure 1 – Probability Ratio (PR)

**@fig-fwi.**  Probability ratio (PR) for an FWI as high as observed in 2019–20 or higher, based on multiple climate models.  

*Source: van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), Figure 6(a).*


As shown in @fig-fwi, all five model ensembles (ERA5, CanESM2, EC-Earth, IPSL-CM6, and weather@home) show **PR > 1**, meaning extreme fire-weather seasons are now more likely than before industrialization.

### 🔹 Table 1 – Key Findings

Table: Summary of the main attribution results for southeast Australia. {#tbl-summary}

| Factor               | Finding              | Interpretation                  |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Extreme FWI season   | PR ≈ **1.3** (+30%)  | Higher baseline fire risk       |
| Extreme heat events  | ≈ **2×** frequency   | More heat-driven danger days    |
| Dryness signal       | **Weak / uncertain** | Drought less determinant        |

@tbl-summary summaries the evidence in plain language.  
Together, these findings directly address the original question:  
**Yes — climate change has measurably increased the likelihood of extreme fire-weather seasons.**

## 🧠 Conclusion

Human-induced climate change has **shifted Australia’s baseline bushfire risk upward**.  
Even though natural variability still affects individual seasons, the overall odds are now “loaded” toward hotter, more dangerous summers.  

To prepare for this new normal, researchers and decision-makers should:  
1. Integrate climate-scenario data into bushfire management and planning.  
2. Strengthen early-warning systems and community education.  
3. Continue fuel-load and land-use management to reduce fire intensity.

As [@Oldenborgh2021] and [@Dowdy2018] highlight, adapting to this warmer world requires both mitigation of greenhouse emissions and practical resilience strategies.
