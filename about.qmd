Hi! I’m **Yao Lu**, a Master of Business Analytics student at **Monash University**.  
I enjoy turning messy data into clear, decision-ready stories. I work mainly in **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2), **Quarto**, and **Git/GitHub**; I’m also comfortable with **Python** and **SQL**.

### Skills
- Data wrangling & visualisation (tidyverse, ggplot2, gt)
- Communicating with Data (Quarto, cross-refs, citations)
- Reproducible workflows (Git/GitHub)
- Basic Python & SQL for analytics

This site is built with **Quarto** and published via **GitHub Pages** as part of **ETC5523 – Communicating with Data**.
